  <p>In her projects, Jess works with various geometrical objects. To simplify the process, she needs to create different classes for the shapes.</p> 
  <p>One of these shapes is a <strong>sphere</strong>. There are 3 characteristics she needs for the sphere: the <em>PI </em>number, the <em>radius <strong>r </strong></em>and the <em>volume <strong>v </strong></em>of the particular sphere.</p> 
  <p>The volume is calculated according to this formula: <strong><span class="math-tex">\(v = \frac {4}{3} \pi r^3\)</span></strong>. </p> 
  <p>Finish writing the code below: determine which attributes are class or instance attributes, and do necessary calculations. Make sure to name the attributes like they are presented above (that is, <code class="java">PI</code>, <code class="java">radius</code>, and <code class="java">volume</code>.) Use <span class="math-tex">\(\pi \approx 3.1415\)</span> (for checkup purposes).</p>
